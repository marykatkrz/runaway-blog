      <h1>Scavenger Hunt Rules</h1>
      <p><em><b>1. Okay, so it may be kinda cheesy - but the first rule is that there aren’t really any rules.</b></em></p>
      <p>The point of creating these adventure games is to keep traveling fun and loose. 	The idea is to have things you want to see and do in mind, but to not stress about planning every second of your trip. If you are the type to plan everything out, that’s fine too! I hope you find these tips useful in your planning. </p>
      <p><em><b>2. Don’t overthink it!</b></em></p>
      <p>I’m not here to sell you a place. I want to keep you informed to make your own decisions of what to do. That is why some of the options will be vague while others are more specific. If “Wake up to the sound of the ocean” is on the list, it’s up to you whether that means you’re at a campground or a beachfront Airbnb! It’s about the experience and how it fits you.</p>
      <p><em><b>3. Items can be completed in any order.</b></em></p>
      <p>Again, the point isn’t to overthink it. It’s about seeing and doing as much as you want to!</p>
      <p><em><b>4. Take pictures and videos.</b></em></p>
      <p>You don’t really have to...but part of the fun is capturing the moments while they are happening. Plus, we all know the saying, “pics or it didn’t happen.” Of course this applies here! If you’re posting the pictures, be sure to use the hashtag #runawaynext so that we can potentially share your adventures as well!</p>
      <p><b>There may not be a prize in the end, or judges tallying up scores. That’s not the point! I just hope you are able to create your own memories while you travel. It’s okay to not finish everything on the list - this is all about having fun!</b></p>
