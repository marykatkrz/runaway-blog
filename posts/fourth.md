Here it is! The third hunt is Oregon - the third place I have lived and where I currently reside! I could have made this hunt much longer and there are lesser known places to explore that I could have put on here, but these are the items I can confirm are a must-do in the state.

*Hunts can be done in any order and items do not always have to be completed based on the suggestions in this blog.*

It's hard to know where to start with Oregon, but it makes sense to begin in the Portland area. What's the first thing you think of when you think of the city? I'm sure many things come to mind, but what about DONUTS?! It's true, Portland has become known for this delicious treat and for good reason. <a href="https://www.voodoodoughnut.com/" target="_blank">Voodoo Doughnuts</a> paved the way with it's funky flavors, but locals will argue that <a href="https://www.bluestardonuts.com/" target="_blank">Blue Star</a> is better. It doesn't stop there, though! <a href="http://www.doedonuts.com/" target="_blank">Doe Donuts</a> is a rising star in the area. No matter where you choose to get them, be sure to try a donut from somewhere in Portland.

*****

If you are downtown at Voodoo, you could walk a couple of blocks to the Burnside Bridge to get a good view of the <a href="https://bestofthenorthwest.com/the-white-stag-sign-portland-oregon/" target="_blank">White Stag Sign</a> (the Portland, Oregon sign.) Snap a few pictures and take a good look at Portland's main river, the Willamette.

*****

If it's the right season, it is highly recommended to check out the <a href="https://www.portland.gov/parks/washington-park-international-rose-test-garden" target="_blank">International Rose Test Garden.</a> With over 650 varieties of roses, taking a stroll through this park is both interesting and beautiful.

*****

Another close by activity worth checking out would be driving (or hiking!) up to the historic <a href="https://pittockmansion.org/" target="_blank">Pittock Mansion</a>. Built in 1914, this impressive structure in the west hills was home to some of the most influential people in Portland history. The beautiful (and potentially haunted) building is usually open for tours, but the view from the property is worth the trip up the winding road alone. Perhaps one of the best views of the city, if it is a clear day you'll be able to see Mount Hood rising in the distance as well. 

*****

And no Oregon list would be complete without mentioning <a href="https://www.powells.com/" target="_blank">Powell's Books,</a> the worlds largest independent bookstore. The building encompasses a whole city block and you can very easily get lost browsing among the thousands of books housed inside this impressive store.

From Portland, there are TONS of day trips you could take. An old favorite would be the little-over-an-hour drive to <a href="https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=151" target="_blank">Silver Falls State Park</a>. This is a beautiful place to stretch your legs, but if you are feeling up to it I recommend the 7+ mile loop called <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Trail_of_Ten_Falls_Loop_Hike" target="_blank">The Trail of Ten Falls</a>. Just like the name implies, you can see 10 gorgeous waterfalls in a peaceful forest on this hike. It's a must-do year round. 

*****

The next option is to head toward Oregon's tallest mountain, Mount Hood. There are numerous hiking options in the area but if you want to see where they filmed the exterior scenes from "The Shining", head up to <a href="https://www.timberlinelodge.com/" target="_blank">Timberline Lodge.</a> Located at 6,000 feet, this 1937 ski lodge is the highest you can drive up the mountain. The views of the area are unparalleled and the surrounding area deserves thousands of pictures.

*****

Perhaps the most popular day trip from the Portland area, however, would be the trip down <a href="https://traveloregon.com/places-to-go/regions/columbia-river-gorge/" target="_blank">the Columbia River Gorge</a>. Stop to see waterfalls on the side of the road, hike to breathtaking views, and take in the gorgeous forest trees. One the most recognizable waterfalls in the U.S. can be found along this stretch of highway as well. <a href="https://www.multnomahfallslodge.com/" target="_blank">Multnomah Falls</a> is 620 feet high and a site to behold in person.

On the other side of the Columbia River Gorge you will find yourself in <a href="https://visithoodriver.com/" target="_blank">Hood River</a>. Anything you end up doing here will be a good time, but the city is known for it's wineries and <a href="https://hoodriverfruitloop.com/" target="_blank">The Hood River Fruit Loop.</a>

*****

For a real adventure, travel down I-84 toward the most eastern part of Oregon to the <a href="https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/destinations/mountains/the-wallowas/" target="_blank">Wallowa Mountains.</a> Known as "Little Switzerland", this area is well worth the drive. 

*****

In case you thought you couldn't get more remote than the Wallowas, head to the Southeasternmost corner of Oregon to find the <a href="https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/destinations/parks-forests-wildlife-areas/the-alvord-desert/" target="_blank">Alvord Desert</a>. You are guaranteed to have an unforgettable experience visiting such a spectacular place.

Heading back a little to more central Oregon, you may end up exploring the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/joda/index.htm" target="_blank">John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.</a> Here you may find the fascinating <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/blue-basin-overlook-trail" target="_blank">Blue Basin Overlook</a> or some red <a href="https://www.nps.gov/joda/planyourvisit/ptd-hills-unit.htm" target="_blank">Painted Hills</a>. 

*****

Heading east once again, you'll find yourself in the Bend area. Bend is one of those mountain towns that is filled with delicious craft breweries and outdoorsy adventures. While you can find great beer all over the state, Bend is famous for their brews.

*****

While you are in Bend, you HAVE to take a quick trip to <a href="https://smithrock.com/" target="_blank">Smith Rock State Park.</a> This otherworldy terrain is remarkable and it is hard to believe that it exists in the state of Oregon.

*****

Next we'll head to the only National Park in the state, but first it feels necessary to mention that Oregon has many great hot springs that should be enjoyed on your trip. Eastern Oregon has some wonderfully isolated ones, but some of the most famous exist in the Cascade Mountain Range. A major one, <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/umpqua/recarea/?recid=66048" target="_blank">Umpqua Hot Springs</a>, can be hit or miss as far as experiences go. We had a good time but I have heard some not so great stories as well. My advice? Check it out and listen to your gut whether or not you want to stay.

<img src="/images/uploads/ump.jpg" />

If you stopped at Umpqua Hot Springs, then you are close by to the deepest lake in the United States: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm" target="_blank">Crater Lake</a>. This is one of the top things to see in Oregon so don't pass this one up!

*****

On the southern side of the state you will find the Rogue River, one of America's top river rafting locations. Book a trip to experience this opportunity first hand for yourself!

*****

Making your way back west, I suggest driving as much of the 101 as possible in Oregon. With jagged rocks and moody skies, the Oregon Coast is something you must witness if you are visiting the state. And don't miss one of Oregon's most famous coastal sites: <a href="https://www.cannonbeach.org/things-to-do/beaches-and-parks/haystack-rock/" target="_blank">Haystack Rock</a>. Watch the sunset here and reflect on your Oregon journey.

There is SO MUCH to do and see in Oregon, so forgive me if I left something out. But as a somewhat underrated location, do not sleep on the opportunity to explore the state if you can.
