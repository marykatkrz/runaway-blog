<h2>PDF: <a href="/images/uploads/mihunt.pdf" target="_blank">Michigan Adventure Hunt</a></h2>

It's hard to know where to begin, you know? There are so many places to cover! I debated a few ideas, but it only seemed right to start with the place I have spent most of my life: Michigan. 

The list was compiled based off of research, but this is also one of those places I happen to have the inside scoop on as well. There is also no specific time to complete the items. Obviously, this list covers a lot of ground and may be best suited for someone that lives in Michigan, although I think an epic road trip would be amazing as well! I hope you find a nice balance of specific things to do and tasks to complete. In this blog, I will give a few examples of how to accomplish these tasks. It is up to you to pick which ones you want to do.

Let's start in the Upper Peninsula, shall we? Or, as us native Michiganders say, "Da U.P." (Seriously, I don't remember ever hearing it called anything else.) The U.P. is where you go to visit **<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Lake-Superior-lake-North-America" target="_blank">Lake Superior</a>**, the largest freshwater lake in the country. A Michigan scavenger hunt would be incomplete without seeing the beautiful wonder that is this lake. 
*****
Located on an island in Lake Superior is **<a href="https://www.nps.gov/isro/index.htm" target="_blank">Isle Royale National Park</a>**, one of the most remote national parks in the nation. In fact, it is so remote that you have to get there by boat or plane!
*****
While you're near Lake Superior, you have to check out **<a href="https://www.nps.gov/piro/index.htm" target="_blank">Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</a>**. This is one of the top things you can do in the state, so I wouldn't miss this if you are nearby.
*****
Perhaps Michigan is not known for it's waterfalls, but the Upper Peninsula does have some hidden gems. One of the most famous would have to be **<a href="https://www.michigan.org/property/tahquamenon-falls-state-park" target="_blank">Tahquamenon Falls</a>**. There are two different set of falls here so make sure you don't miss one! 
*****
One of the more secluded items on this list would have to be Michigan's largest freshwater spring: **<a href="http://www.visitmanistique.com/bigspring.shtml" target="_blank">Kitch-iti-kipi</a>**. This turquoise wonder is a beautiful site and visitors travel many miles to view it's stunning water.

As you leave the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, you will need to drive over one of the longest suspension bridges in the country. The **<a href="https://www.mackinacbridge.org/" target="_blank">Mackinac Bridge</a>** is a site in itself, so much so that many people drive across just to say they did it.
*****
No Michigan adventure list would be complete without including **<a href="https://www.mackinacisland.org/" target="_blank">Mackinac Island</a>**. **<a href="https://www.grandhotel.com/" target="_blank">The Grand Hotel</a>** is one reason to visit alone. This stunning building was built in 1887 and is known as "The worlds largest summer hotel." You can visit it by taking a short jaunt from downtown Mackinac Island, however, you will need to do so by bike or by horse as no vehicles are allowed on the island! While you're visiting, it is highly recommended to buy some Mackinac Island fudge. I don't know if there's anything different about it, but fudge just tastes better on the island. 
*****
As you round the corner from the bridge, you may want to check out Traverse City. Home of the Cherry Capital of the World, **<a href="https://www.traversecity.com" target="_blank">Traverse City</a>** is delightful whether the cherries are in season or not. 
*****
Named after the dune that looks like a sleeping bear, **<a href="https://www.nps.gov/slbe/index.htm" target="_blank">Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore</a>** is also a must see. We grew up learning about the legend of this place and it most definitely belongs on this list.  
*****
Don't forget to make your way inland a bit to check out **<a href="https://www.experiencegr.com/" target="_blank">Grand Rapids</a>**. Known as **Beer City USA**, you will not have a difficult time finding unique Michigan brews.
*****
If the timing is right, the Dutch village of Holland, Michigan hosts one of the best **<a href="https://www.holland.org/events/tulip-festival" target="_blank">tulip festivals</a>** in the world. 
*****
As you make your way down the Lake Michigan shoreline, be sure to stop in the quaint beach towns along the way. **<a href="https://www.visitludington.com/" target="_blank">Ludington</a>, <a href="https://visitpentwater.com/" target="_blank">Pentwater</a>, <a href="https://www.saugatuck.com/" target="_blank">Saugatuck</a>, and <a href="https://www.southhaven.org/" target="_blank">South Haven</a>** are all worth checking out. Numerous lighthouse also dot the shoreline as well. In fact, Michigan is home to about **<a href="https://www.michigan.org/lighthouses#?c=44.4299:-85.1166:6&tid=54&page=0&pagesize=20&pagetitle=Lighthouses" target="_blank">124 lighthouses</a>** so odds are you will run into one or two.

Cutting across the bottom half of the state (my stopping grounds!) will eventually take you to the **<a href="https://visitdetroit.com/" target="_blank">Detriot</a>** area. I know it gets a bad rap, but Detroit actually has a lot to offer! Check out the history of the locomotive at the **<a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/" target="_blank">Henry Ford Museum</a>**, or Motown's first headquarters at **<a href="https://www.motownmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Hitsville, USA</a>**. Don't forget the famous **<a href="https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/coney-dog" target="_blank">Coney Dogs</a>** Michigan is famous for. Coneys, which are topped with a meaty sauce, are a state staple and the competition may never end when it comes to determining who makes the best one. 
*****
Also in the Detroit area is **<a href="https://www.michigan.org/property/belle-isle-park" target="_blank">Belle Isle Park</a>**. Home to an aquarium, conservatory, zoo, and golf course, you will not be bored visiting this isle. 
*****
Heading north you will find the cute Bavarian village of **<a href="https://www.frankenmuth.org/" target="_blank">Frankenmuth</a>**. Not only is the town fun to explore, but it is also home to the **<a href="https://bronners.com/" target="_blank">"World's Largest Christmas Store"</a>**. It doesn't matter if it's the holidays or not, this store is worth seeing all year round.
*****
Last but certainly not least, we'll head up to the "thumb" of Michigan. It is here that you will find **<a href="https://thumbwind.com/2018/02/20/turnip-rock-things-to-know/" target="_blank">Turnip Rock</a>**. It's, well, a rock that looks like a turnip! A seven mile kayak trip on Lake Huron is worth it to see this geological wonder.

Maybe Michigan wasn't on your list of places to visit before, but I hope it is now. With so much to offer, how can you resist?
