Happy New Year!

I know I've been MIA for a while, but let's face it - 2020 wasn't exactly the year for travel. 

I, like many others, didn't know where this blog was going to go either. In a world full of travel bloggers and influencers, how do you stand out?

Well, I am not sure that I have that answer. But I do have an idea.

Back in September, my fiance and I went on a weekend camping trip to the central Oregon coast. We are not ones to plan out an entire getaway from start to finish, but we did have a list of things we wanted to do and see. It wasn't until the weekend that we realized exactly what we had done - completed a scavenger hunt!

And that is how an idea is born. 

I hope to use this platform to create scavenger hunts for various locations, along with opportunities to learn something about the area. 

Super excited to put some work in and learn a bit more myself. Run Away Next is back, baby!
