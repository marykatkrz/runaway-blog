Tennessee was the second state that I lived in, so it only made sense for the next hunt to feature the Volunteer State!

It's been a few years since I lived in Nashville, but I like to think I was able to explore some very interesting places in the two years that I lived there. As a result, I have put together this scavenger hunt to discover some of the best Tennessee has to offer.

*Hunts can be done in any order and items do not always have to be completed based on the suggestions in this blog.*

It seems only natural to start in Nashville, doesn't it? Just about smack dab in the middle of the state, Tennessee's largest city has so much to offer. A growing tourist destination for both families and bachelorette parties alike, there is something for everyone in this southern town. 

*****

You may start your day bright and early doing something not many consider when visiting Music City: kayaking (or canoeing!) on one of the nearby rivers. The Cumberland cuts right through the city and is a <a href="https://rqvoyages.com/kayaking" target="_blank">popular spot for kayaking,</a> but there are other options if you want to get out of the city as well. I personally had a great time canoeing on the Harpeth River a few years ago with <a href="http://www.foggybottomcanoe.com/p/main.html" target="_blank">Foggy Bottom Canoe.</a> No matter what you decide to do you will not be disappointed.

*****

Once you are done a kayaking, you may find yourself wandering around one of Nashvilles many adorable neighborhoods. <a href="http://nashvilleguru.com/neighborhoods/germantown" target="_blank">Germantown,</a> <a href="http://nashvilleguru.com/neighborhoods/12-south" target="_blank">12 South,</a> and <a href="http://nashvilleguru.com/neighborhoods/gulch" target="_blank">The Gulch</a> offer a diverse list of shops to satisfy all your window shopping needs. 

*****

By this point you might start feeling hungry. There may be plenty of restaurants nearby, but if you're looking for some real Nashville food you better look for some hot chicken. <a href="https://hattieb.com/" target="_blank">Hattie B's</a> and <a href="https://www.princeshotchicken.com/" target="_blank">Prince's</a> are the most famous of Nashville hot chicken spots. That being said, there are numerous other options to try the local cuisine as well. No matter where you get the dish, just go out and try it!

*****

After lunch take a tour of The Mother Church - Ryman Auditorium. With 128 years of musical artists gracing the stage, this is hallowed ground in the music industry. Many big moments in music history occurred on this stage, so go ahead and learn a little bit about real Nashville history.

*****

Nashville has become quite the tourist town, but perhaps one of the most surprising tourist attractions around is simply to take a picture with a mural. Folks will line up down the street to get a picture in front of the famous <a href="https://kelseymontagueart.com/nashville-whatliftsyou-wings/" target="_blank">What Lift's You</a> mural. Can you blame them? It's so cute!

By this point you may want to take a break to get ready for your evening. Maybe you have dinner reservations at a hip place in town. If you do, it's not unlikely that you will see a celebrity or two! It's also possible that you will have tickets to a show, so no matter how it happens the odds of you seeing a star in person are pretty great. 

*****

Once dinner and/or the show are over it's time to find out why the city is sometimes called "Nashvegas". Head downtown to the honky tonks to party the rest of the night away! Even if you don't drink, it is something to behold. Crowds gather on the sidewalks and every bar has a band playing, often with a different one on each story. 

*****

Next, you might want to head east toward <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm" target="_blank">Great Smoky Mountain National Park.</a> But don't forget about the rest of Tennessee! There are several wonderful <a href="https://tnstateparks.com/about/find-a-park" target="_blank">Tennessee State Parks</a> along the way that you will not want to miss. Highlights include Fall Creek Falls, Rock Island, and Cummins Falls (pictured below).

As you make your way east, you will see the terrrain begin to change. Mountains will rise up in the distance and you'll know you're getting close to Great Smoky Mountain National Park (where it's totally possible to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/nature/black-bears.htm" target="_blank">see a bear!</a>). Before you get there, though, you will cross through a couple of mountain towns. A favorite of travelers, <a href="https://www.gatlinburg.com/" target="_blank">Gatlinburg, Tennessee</a> is a must stop. You'll find many hotels in town, but there are numerous cabins to choose from as well if you want some more seclusion. 

*****

While you're in the area, it is worth making a day of Dolly Parton's own theme park, <a href="https://www.dollywood.com/" target="_blank">Dollywood,</a> in nearby Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. With rides, shows, and dining options available, you will have plenty of activities to choose from to keep busy. Rumor has it that Dolly herself will wander the park from time to time as well, so keep an eye out for her!

*****

If you are in the area, it would be a mistake to not spend a day or two exploring the Smoky Mountains! With about 800 miles of trails in the smokies, it would be a good idea to take at least a short jaunt through the woods. There are, however, many old favorites to keep in mind: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/chimneys-alternative-charlies-bunion.htm" target="_blank">Charlies Bunion (along the Appalachian Trail!),</a> <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/chimneys-alternative-alum-cave-bluffs.htm" target="_blank">Alum Cave Bluffs,</a> and <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/chimney-tops.htm" target="_blank">Chimney Tops</a> are just a few of my favorites.

*****

If hiking isn't really your thing, that is okay! The highest point in the state of Tennessee is actually a fairly short, paved path. At 6,643 <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/clingmansdome.htm" target="_blank">Clingmans Dome</a> is a must stop when visiting the park. 

<img src="/images/uploads/clingman.jpg" />

Once you feel you have sufficiently explored eastern Tennesee, it's a good idea to head south to Chattanooga. Another outdoorsy town, there is lots to do and see here. One of the top options would be to see <a href="https://www.rubyfalls.com/" target="_blank">one of the tallest underground waterfalls</a> in the country.

*****

If you are staying or eating in downtown Chattanooga, it's also fun to stretch your legs on one of the <a href="https://www.visitchattanooga.com/listing/walnut-street-pedestrian-bridge/2485/" target="_blank">"the worlds longest pedestrian bridges."</a>

*****

After exploring Chattanooga, it's time to head west toward Memphis. Filled with various museums, spanning from <a href="https://www.civilrightsmuseum.org/" target="_blank"> the National Civil Rights Museum</a> to <a href="https://staxmuseum.com/" target="_blank">the Stax Museum of American Soul Music</a> for some music history, there is something for everyone in town.

*****

And no Tennessee list would be complete without mentioning <a href="https://www.graceland.com/" target="_blank">Graceland</a>. Explore Elvis Preseley's home, and if you're lucky you'll see the ghost of the King of Rock N Roll himself.

Even with it's growing popularity, Tennessee remains a somewhat underrated travel destination. Why not check it out yourself?
